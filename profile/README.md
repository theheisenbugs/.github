## hello! welcome to the heisenbugs üêõ
We are both college juniors looking to enter the sphere of software engineering and web development.

Our inspiration for the team name came from when we stumbled across the term heisenbug, which has its origins in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. In physics, it's impossible to simultaneously know the position and velocity of a particle, i.e. when we try to observe the particle, it changes its behavior. 

Analogously, heisenbugs are programming bugs that seemingly disappear when you try to observe or debug them. We aimed to incorporate this into our identity since a **huge** majority of coding is just debugging -- and we wanted to pay homage to that! 

Take a look at our projects below!
